# JetBrains Academy To-Do List (JavaScript) Project

An example of a passing solution to the final phase of the JetBrains Academy Frontend Core To-Do List (JavaScript) project.

## Description

It includes styling adjustments to support a consistent appearance for multiple browsers.

The web page has semantic elements defining its structure. The web page stores the task list in local storage to persist the list between sessions.

## Notes

The relative directory structure was kept the same as the one used in my JetBrains Academy solution.

The project uses [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for CSS linting with the [Recess* Property Order](https://github.com/stormwarning/stylelint-config-recess-order) plugin to ensure consistent ordering of the CSS properties. Most of the CSS standards are from [@mdo's Code Guide](https://codeguide.co/#css-syntax).

JavaScript is done in the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).
